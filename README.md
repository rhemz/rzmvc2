rzMVC
======

<b>rzMVC</b> lightweight PHP MVC framework.  
<ul>
<li>Framework sits inside 'framework' directory</li>
<li>User application resides inside 'application' directory</li>
<li>Set your apache root to to www/ directory</li>
</ul>


I've included a super-simple multi user todo-list manager as a sample application; as a means of demonstrating
usage of various framework components and handling common tasks i.e form validation, session management, etc.
You can see a running version of the app (go ahead, create an account and click around) <a href="http://mvctest.russellz.com">here</a>.

Once v1.0 is ready, I'll provide a link to a zipfile containing everything needed to build a web application
quickly and efficiently.


Full documentation to be completed after framework is in a completely usable state.  For now, the in-code
documentation will have to do :)
