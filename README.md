rzMVC
======

<b>rzMVC</b> lightweight PHP MVC framework.  
<ul>
<li>Framework sits inside 'framework' directory</li>
<li>User application resides inside 'application' directory</li>
<li>Unit tests reside in 'tests' directory</li>
<li>Set your apache root to to www/ directory</li>
</ul>


I've included a super-simple multi user todo-list manager as a sample application as a means of demonstrating
what you can do with a few simple classes, as well as usage of various framework components and handling common 
tasks i.e form validation, session management, database interaction, etc. You can see a running version of the 
app (go ahead, create an account and click around) <a href="http://mvctest.russellz.com"><b>here</b></a>.


You can grab a zip ready for development/deployment <a href="http://mvc.russellz.com/files/rzmvc_dev_20130214.zip"><b>here</b></a>.


Full documentation to be completed after framework is in a completely usable state.  For now, the in-code
documentation will have to do.
